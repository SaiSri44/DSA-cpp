------------------**maths formulas**---------------------

every odd number can be return as the difference of square nsumbers
i.e $(n+1)^2$ - $n^2$ = 2*n+1
2*n+1 is the general form of the odd number,so any odd number can be writen as the difference of two squares of numbers.
more precisely given odd number n let's say $k = n/2$ then **n = $(k+1)^2$ - $k^2$**

**Every non prime number is composite**

**Combanotrics**
$nC0 +nC1 + nC2 ------------nCn$ = $2^n$
$nC1 + nC2+--------nCn$= $2^n - 1$

**nCr = n-1Cr-1 + n-1Cr**

**sum of the odd binomail coffiecnets**
k = n-1
$nC1 + nC3 + nC5 ------- $= $2^k$

**sum of the even binomial coffiencets**
k = n-1,basically 2 power n-1
$nC0+nC2+nC4-------$= $2^k$

**For given n sided polygon,number of diagonal is** **$nC2-n$**
because out of n vertices we can chooses 2 vertices,and out of them chosen vertices they can form edges tooo, so we subtract them the no of edges i.e n

**For given n sided polygon, number of intersection points of diagonal is $nC4$**
Because for two diagonals we need four vertices, these two diagonals have 1 intersection point, so total intesection points is equal to nC4


$C(n,n) + C(n+1,n) + C(n+2,n) ----C(n+k,n) = C(n+k+1,k)$

$sum(C(n,i)*C(m,k-i)) over i in [0,k]$ = $C(n+m,k)$ 
this is no of ways of picking i balls from 1st bag containing n balls and k-i balls from second bag containing m balls
