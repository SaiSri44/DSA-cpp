---------------------Recursion -------------
Function calling iteself is called Recursion 

There are two phases in recursion

forwarding phase 
returning phase 

Recursion can be classified into 
1.Tail Recursion
2.Head Recursion
3.Indirect  Recursion
4.Nested Recursion 
5.Linear Recursion
6.Tree Recursion

Tail Recursion 
in tail recursion recurrence relation is the last statement in function there are no further statements after recursive relation 

Head Recursion 
in Head recursion recursive call is the first statemetn inside the function so any calculation is performed in the returning time only 

Linear REcursion 
In linear recursion there is only one recursive call it is not at the starting or at ending it is between the function statements 

TRee Recursion 
In tree recursion there are more than 2 recursive calls inside the function .

Indirect Recursion
in indirect recursion the function B is called inside a function A and so on 

Nested Recursion
in nested recursion the parameter inside the recursive call is also a function call
