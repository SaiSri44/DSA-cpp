 in this we will look at the intro to the data structures 

 what is DS 
 Data structures are used for organising the data more effictively
 classification of data structures 

           -----------------------------------Data Structures -------------------------
           primitive                -                   -----------------Non primitive-------------
           1.int                                    linear                                    Non linear
           2.float                                  array                                       graphs
           3.char                                   stack                                       hash maps
           4.double                                 queue
                                                    linked list
 array and linked list are called physical data structures 
 remaining data structures are known as the logical data structures because the implementation of the rest of data structures is done by constraining the properties of the physcial data structures 


 ----------Algorthims-----------
 Algorthims is nothing but the sequential steps followed to acccomplish a desired task 

 Algorthims can be classified into 
 1.Simple recursive Algorthim
 2.Divide and conquer Algorthim
 3.Dynamic programming Algorthim 
 4.Greedy Algothim
 5.Brute Force Algorthim 
 6.Randomized Algorthim 

 Simple Recursive Algothim 

 In this recursion is used to accomplish the task 

 Divide and conquer Algorthim 

 Divide the problem into smaller subproblems of the same type and solve the subproblem recursively 
 Combine the solution of the subproblem into a solution of the original problem 
ex : binary search algorthim ,qucik sort,merge sort 

Dynamic Programming Algorthim 

in this type of Algorthim the results that are computed before are utilised to compute the futher values 
that mean they work based on memotization 

Brute Force Algorthim 

It simply tries all the possibillites until the satisfactory solution is found

Randomized Algorthim

use a random number at least once during the computation to make a decision
