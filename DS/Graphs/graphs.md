Terminologies in GRaphs

Graph is the combination of edges and vertices. Graphs can be directed,undirected,cyclic and acylic.
**Directed Graphs**
Graphs in which the edges have direction are called directed graphs
**Undirected Graphs** 
Graphs in which edges don't have any directions are called Undirected Graphs
**Cyclc Graphs**:
Graphics in which the cycle exists are called cyclic graphs,these can be directed or undirected graphs
**Acyclic Graphs**
Grpahs in which the cycle does not exists is called Acylic graphs,these are directonl only. In undirectional graphs cyclic exists 
**Trees (Undirected Acylic graphs)**
Undirected graph without cycle(Acylic) is called trees. Tree consists of n vertices and n-1 edges. More than n-1 edges forms a cycle.
**Connected Component**
It is the part of the graphs,in which from one node we can visit all other nodes in that component.
Graphs can be combination of Connected components and unconnected components.
