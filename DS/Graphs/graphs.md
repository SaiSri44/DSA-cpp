Terminologies in GRaphs

Graph Definition:
Graph is the combination of edges and vertices. Graphs can be directed,undirected,cyclic and acylic.

Classification of Graphs:

Based on direction :

**Directed Graphs** 
Graphs in which the edges have direction are called directed graphs
**Undirected Graphs**
Graphs in which edges don't have any directions are called Undirected Graphs.

Directed Graphs classification :

**Acyclic Graph**
Directed graphs in which there is no cycle present
**cyclic Graph**
directed graphs which has cycle in it.

Based on Labelling :

**unlabelled graph**
The graph in which both vertices and edges are unlabled.
**vertex labeled**
Graph in which vertexes are labelled and edges are unlabelled
**Edges labelled**
Graph in which edges are labelled and vertexres are unlabelled.

Based on Weights
**weighted**
Graph in which edges has some weights.
**unweighted**
Graph in which edges has no weights.

**Fully Connected Graphs**
the graph in which there are edges from every node  to every other node in graph is called fully connected graph.


Grpahs in which the cycle does not exists is called Acylic graphs,these are directonl only. In undirectional graphs cyclic exists 
**Trees (Undirected Acylic graphs)**
Undirected graph without cycle(Acylic) is called trees. Tree consists of n vertices and n-1 edges. More than n-1 edges forms a cycle.
**Connected Component**
It is the part of the graphs,in which from one node we can visit all other nodes in that component.
Graphs can be combination of Connected components and unconnected components.
